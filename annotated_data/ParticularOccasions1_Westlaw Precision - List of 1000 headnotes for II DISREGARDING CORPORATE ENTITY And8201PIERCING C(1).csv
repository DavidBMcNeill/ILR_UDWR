The United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Robert M. Hill, J., dismissed, and plaintiff appealed.  The Court of Appeals, Reavley, Circuit Judge, held that: (1) district court incorrectly applied doctrine of functionality and, hence, its finding that plaintiff's bottle design was not distinctive could not be upheld, and (2) finding that defendant had no intent to infringe plaintiff's trade dress was clearly erroneous.  In addition, the court set forth the law as to the meaning and application of doctrine of functionality. Affirmed in part, reversed and remanded in part.",
