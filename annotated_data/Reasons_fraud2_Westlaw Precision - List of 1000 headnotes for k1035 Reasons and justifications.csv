The District Court, Batts, J., held that: (1) under Delaware law, broker's pleadings were insufficient as a matter of law to show that corporation and its subsidiary were single economic unit, for purpose of piercing corporate veil in order to bring breach of brokerage agreement action against corporation, and (2) broker's complaint, alleging that corporation was involved in fraudulent scheme to avoid paying broker, failed to plead elements of fraud with required amount of specificity.
