The District Court, Weber, Chief Judge, held that: (1) Uniform Commercial Code section dealing with situation where goods are delivered to person under name other than name of person making delivery did not apply; (2) theory of unitary business enterprise did not bar owner's claim, and (3) warehouse receipts issued by sister entity of food distributor were valid and protected owner's interest in bailed potato products.
