The 146th District Court, Bell County, W. A. Messer, J., granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, adjudged contract null and void and dismissed defendant buyers' counterclaim, and buyers appealed. The Court of Civil Appeals, Phillips, C.J., held that evidence presented questions of fact precluding summary judgment as to whether contract was null and void on theory that Federal Communications Commission had not approved contract or on theory that contract was in contravention of statute requiring that business and affairs of corporation shall be managed by board of directors since board of broadcasting company had apparently not passed on the contract and further held that provision for payment in the contract was sufficiently definite. Judgment reversed and cause remanded for trial on the merits.",
