The ordinary presumption is that when a corporation has been formed in the manner provided by law it continues to have existence as a separate and distinct entity. When it is claimed that a corporation is in reality not a separate entity but is merely an adjunct or department or instrumentality of another corporation for purposes of fraud, the burden rests upon those so contending to prove the fact.
